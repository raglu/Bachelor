	Instructions for how to use the scripts in this directory:


Testing:

	If only some of the programs need to be tested, use run.select as
	follows:

		run.select program1 program2 ...

	"Run" will execute run.stdin, run.file, run.cp or run.pty depending on
	the definition in run.master.  These are discussed below.


Adding programs to these test cases:

	To do this you have to edit the run.master script file. 
	
	First find out how the program reads its input. 
	
     -	If it reads input from stdin, put the following line in the run.master 
	file:
	
		run.stdin programname [parameters]


     -	If the program takes its input from a file, put the following line in 
	the run.master file:

		run.file programname [parameters]

        A test file will then be supplied as the last argument.
	For program like diff, that compares files, one of the test files are
	also given as a parameter to the program.


     -	If the program only takes its input from a file with a special name 
	put the following line in the run.master file:

		run.cp [-] filename programname [parameters]

        This will cause the script to copy a test file to filename before
	executing the program. The filename will be given as the last
	parameter unless a '-' is given.


	"Run.master" contains lots of examples.
